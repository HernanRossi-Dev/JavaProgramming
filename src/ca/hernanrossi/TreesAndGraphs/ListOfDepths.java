 * Created by Hernan Rossi
 * Problem Description:
 *              Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes at each depth(e.g.
 *                  if you have a tree with depth D, you'll have D linked lists:
 *Solution method:
 *              Traversing the binary tree in a depth first search manner and creating a new linked lilst for every
 *                  2^n nodes ( a new linked list for every level in the tree) then well will have a linked list for
 *                  every level in the tree.
